# Georgia Linear Circuits Utils

A few programs to help you do calculations on the command line.

Using a calculator is slow! Use the power of your ten fingers to make the tests on time.

## Usage

```bash
impedance/inverse_impedance 1 1
impedance/parallel_impedance 1 1 2 2
impedance/rect2pol 4 3
impedance/pol2rect 5 30
```

Input complex numbers as the real part followed by the imaginary part. All input and output angles are in degress.

## TODO

 * Matrices
 * Linear Equations Solver
